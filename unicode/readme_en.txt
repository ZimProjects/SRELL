Contents of this directory:

  1. ucfdataout2.cpp
  2. updataout3.cpp

  These need to be compiled and run on a system that supports
  an ISO-646/US-ASCII compatible encoding.

----
1. ucfdataout2.cpp

  This is a C++ source file for a program that generates a newer version
of srell_ucfdata2.h, which SRELL includes for case-insensitive matching. It
is generated by ucfdataout2 with CaseFolding.txt provided by the Unicode
Consortium.

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | What is CaseFolding.txt?
  |
  |   It is a data file needed for case-insensitive matching based on the
  | Unicode Standard. Whenever a new version of the Unicode Standard is
  | released, CaseFolding.txt may also be updated accordingly.
  |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-1. Usage

    1) compile ucfdataout2.cpp,
    2) get the latest version of CaseFolding.txt, which is available at
       http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt ,
    3) put CaseFolding.txt and a binary file generated at 1) in the same
       directory and run the binary file,
    4) move the newly generated "srell_ucfdata2.h" to the directory in where
       SRELL is put.

  1-2. Compatibility

    srell_ucfdata2.h:   SRELL 4.030-. The format is the same as
                        srell_ucfdata2.hpp. Only the suffix is changed.
    srell_ucfdata2.hpp: SRELL 2.500-4.029
    srell_ucfdata.hpp:  SRELL -2.401

----
2. updataout3.cpp

  This is a C++ source file for a program that generates a newer version
of srell_updata3.h, which SRELL includes for Unicode property escapes
(\p{...} and \P{...}). It is generated by updataout3 with the following text
files provided by the Unicode Consortium:

  * DerivedCoreProperties.txt
  * DerivedNormalizationProps.txt
  * emoji-data.txt
  * PropertyValueAliases.txt
  * PropList.txt
  * ScriptExtensions.txt
  * Scripts.txt
  * UnicodeData.txt
  * emoji-sequences.txt
  * emoji-zwj-sequences.txt

  As well as CaseFolding.txt mentioned above, these files may be updated
accordingly whenever a new version of the Unicode Standard is released.

  2-1. Usage

    1) compile updataout3.cpp,
    2) get the latest versions of the text files mentioned above, which are
       available at:
       a. emoji-data.txt: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/emoji/
       b. emoji-sequences.txt and emoji-zwj-sequences.txt:
          http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/(version number)/
       c. others: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/ ,
    3) put the text files and a binary file generated at 1) in the same
       directory and run the binary file,
    4) move the newly generated "srell_updata3.h" to the directory in where
       SRELL is put.

  2-2. Compatibility

    srell_updata3.h:   SRELL 4.030-
    srell_updata2.hpp: SRELL 4.000-4.029
    srell_updata.hpp:  SRELL -3.018
